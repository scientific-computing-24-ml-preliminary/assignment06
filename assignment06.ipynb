(First generate a sample of values $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ from $X$ using standard functions from `np.random` or `scipy.stats`, than calculate $y_1, \\ldots, y_n$.) Plot histogram of that sample with `density=True` and graph of $p_Y(y)$ on the same picture. They should match. Try increasing number of samples and number of bins. How the limit behaviour of $p_Y(y)$ at 0 affects the histogram as number of samples and number of bins becomes large?"

In this task, we implement and analyze a simple algorithm that can be used to solve this problem.\n",

Indeed, from the condition $\\int_{\\mathbb R} p(x)\\, dx=1$, it follows immediately that $1/c=\\int_{\\mathbb R} s(x)\\, dx$. Then it is possible to find $F(x)$ by integration and use the recipe from Task 4 to make samples. However, it is possible that the integral for $c$ is difficult to compute, even numerically, because evaluation of $s$ at a specific point can be costly from a computational point of view. In this case, a less straightforward algorithm is needed.\n",
